# Target and Objective
The Domain Driven Architecture is organized in useful building blocks for IT-Systems. 
These building blocks we will form as feature documentation.  

## Intended Reader
IT Operations, IT Architects, developers and product owners.

## Structure of Feature Documentation
* __Change History__: The change history will contain the features history and description for feature doc releases.
* __Scope__: Target, intended reader and usage context.
* __Analysis__: Concepts and remarkable informations on the way to get a better understanding of the problem to solve.
* __Requirements__: There are two important elements in the requirements part. 
  * On the one hand the requirements itself, which are reflecting the stakeholder's demand. 
  * On the other hand, there is the history of requirements - who took the decision, what where the reasons.
* __Architecture__: Architecture decomposes the problem described in requirements. Elements described in this part will be referred in requirements part to classify requirements and in realization part for implementing described concepts.
* __Realization__: There are four intended reader types for realization documentation:
  * Software Developers
  * Decision Makers
  * System Users
  * System Operators
