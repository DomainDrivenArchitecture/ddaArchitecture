# General conditions for this document
##  Rationale and objectives
Nearly every system could be described with the global requirement „someone should do something“. In another extreme, it's possible to bind 80% of the development team with the documentation of requirements without any problems.
The described requirements management illustrates the chosen and efficient trade-off in the context of the project „PolitAktiv“. The objectives are:
* Creating an agile requirements analysis environment, that works in a high dynamic team and with voluntary staff.
* A requirements management that matches with an iterative approach.
* For keeping the focus, prioritisation has to support on all levels.
* TestFirst should be positioned in the method.

## Target group
The target group for this document are requirements analysts, IT product manager, departmental staff affected by IT projects, IT project manager, IT architects and quality control directors.  
## Scope and delimitation
This document illuminates the structuring and management of requirements. The exemplified ideas stand in the context of DomainDrivenArchitecture.org. This means particularly, that
* Methods for requirements analysis – especially for validation and consistency of requirements – are illuminated in a separate document.
* Domain Driven Design makes a stable separation between technical architecture and business architecture possible. The interaction and the actual technical architecture are illuminated in a separate document. 
* This separation between technical and business architecture allows – in a first realisation phase  - to focus on the business architecture (and the business interface). According to this, in this document non-functional requirements are discussed only marginally.
