### Explain to reflect
When I am faced with the task to explain my insights to another person, I often experience that these insights are not as clear as they seemed to be for me in advance. In such situations the picture in my mind changes regularly.
According to my observation, there is a similar effect when writing down requirements.
The aversion to  write down requirements may be motivated in this mental work â€“ and simultaneously emphasizes how necessary it is.
