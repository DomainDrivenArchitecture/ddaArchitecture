### Reminder
Also in a cooperative periphery, contracts have an added value as a reminder. In this regard, written requirements are very similar to a contract, as they fix the agreements. Consequently, some discussion will be brought to a more objective level and frustration will be avoided.
A second important aspect is that you can make notes
* who requested this topic (and whom you have to talk to in case of a change)
* why the team has decided x-y (to avoid repeating discussions).
