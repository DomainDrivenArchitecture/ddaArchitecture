### Balancing act between intelligibility and clarity
The description of the requirements should not be too extensive in order to keep them clear. But then the participants should be able to understand the requirements even after several years. Therefore, all important details must be included.
To address this problem, it's a good strategy to
* define the requirements audience, e.g. which information should be noted
	* for the author himself to remember after one year all the relevant informations or
	* for departments staff members, to apprise requirements,
* start with hight abstraction and become consistent on this level and
* drill down in important cases.
