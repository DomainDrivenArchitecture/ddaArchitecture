### Balancing act between intelligibility and clarity
In order to keep the description of the requirements clear, they should not be too extensive. But then the participants should be able to understand the requirements even after several years. Therefore, all important details must be included.
To address this problem, it's a good strategy to
* define the requirements audience, e.g. which information should be noted
	* for the author himself to remember after one year all the relevant informations or
	* for department staff members, to apprise requirements,
* start with a high level of abstraction and become consistent at this level
* To keep important details in important cases.
