### Change of requirements over time
The whole world is changing as fast that IT has a lot of trouble to keep pace. This is also the case for managed requirements, particularly in the following dimensions:
The change of requirement is of interest at the level of a individual requirement: How has the requirement evolved? Who initiated the change? What were the reasons for the former decision and do these reasons still exist?
The changes of complete requirement networks are also of interest â€“ in the terms of continuing the analysis of the requirements while a stable version is implemented in parallel.
Dealing with both of these requirements in version control are described in the appendix.
