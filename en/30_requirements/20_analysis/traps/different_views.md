### Different Views
In the simplest case, you need only one view on the requirements. Typically, this view connects the business architecture with the requirements included.
But often there will be the need for more different views after short time: For the testing team, for the project teams, for further specification, for operation or for training.
A method providing only one view, will not be sufficient at all. Therefore different views are considered in the presented approach.
