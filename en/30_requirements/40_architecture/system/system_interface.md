##### System Interface (6.)
System interfaces are often derived from functional requirements. But interfaces can also have their origin in used external systems. 
Elements of an interface description are:
* version: The version of an interface – because it happens that the interface of an external system is changing without considering the associated systems.
* source: the source system
* sink: the system that uses data
* data Structure: data structure for the provided data
* description: unstructured description – when information is provided/ fetched, quality of providing, validity period, error handling. 

Tips for an efficient notation would be appreciated.
