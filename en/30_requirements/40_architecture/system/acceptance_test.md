#### Acceptance test (3.)
In an acceptance test is described what has to be fulfilled that the requirement is seen as implemented. While requirements are expressed on a high level of abstraction as far as possible, important details can be described in tests.
Examples for test descriptions are in appendix in chapter 5.4 The associated acceptance test.
