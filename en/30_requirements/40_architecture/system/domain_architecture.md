#### DomainArchitecture (8.)
The domain architecture or professional architecture describes the differentiation of the technical problem. New findings that arise during analysis, trial or implementation certainly lead to a change in differentiation and structure in the domain architecture.
To ensure that these changes do not have a massive effect on already existing requirements, the semantic link between requirements and the domain architecture is realized by means of requirements views.
The elements used in the domain architecture like aggregates, entities, repositories, etc. are described in the Domain Driven Design.
