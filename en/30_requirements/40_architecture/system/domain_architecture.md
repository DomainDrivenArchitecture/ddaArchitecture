#### DomainArchitecture (8.)
The domain architecture describes the differentiation of the technical problem. New findings that arise during analysis, trial or implementation certainly lead to a change in differentiation and structure in the domain architecture.
So that this change hasn't such an intense impact on the existing requirements, the semantic link between requirement and domain architecture is realized by requirements views.
The elements used in the domain architecture like aggregates, entities, repositories are described in Domain Driven Design.
