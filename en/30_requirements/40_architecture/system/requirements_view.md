#### Requirements view (7.)
Views are used to structure requirements. Views correspond to printable documents, composed for the appropriate topic and target audience.
In the requirements view, requirements are only referred for not padding in the DRY-trap. For not having only links in printable documents, a tooling is very helpful that shows content from referenced requirements, too (see appendix,  5.6 A view). 
In a further expansion stage, the possibility of an additional limitation on other structural elements is very useful (Title, Stakeholder,...).
