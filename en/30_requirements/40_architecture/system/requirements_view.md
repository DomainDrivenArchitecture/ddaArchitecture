#### Requirements view (7.)
Views are used to structure requirements. Views correspond to printable documents, composed for the appropriate topic and target audience.
In order not to land in the DRY trap, requirements are only referenced here. In order to not only have links in printable documents, a tooling is very helpful which can also display content of referenced requests, too (see appendix,  5.6 A view). 
In a further expansion stage, the possibility of an additional limitation on other structural elements is very useful (Title, Stakeholder,...).
