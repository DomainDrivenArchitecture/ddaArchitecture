##### Non-functional requirements (4.)
The source of non-functional requirements are often technical frame conditions (memory size, network bandwidth etc.) or performance specifications.
A proven notation for non-functional requirements is the “Goal oriented Requirements Language Notation” (GRL).
GRL allows to illuminate the “why” of non-functional requirements. In my opinion, that's helpful because the circumstances for e.g. “requests have to be answered in 50 ms” can be completely changed. Than it's helpful to know the why.
