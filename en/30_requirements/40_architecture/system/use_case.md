##### Use Case (5.)
Use cases are the classical representatives for functional requirements. 
Sources for functional requirements are the desired functional features or are derived from legal conditions (e.g. privacy). Use cases are closely associated with the budget sponsoring stakeholder.
A use case describes how a system allows an actor to reach a target. 
* ID – the unique identifier, is given once at the beginning.
* title – the title, a short summary
* state – [premature, mature, deprecated]
* actor – who is the agent
* stakeholders And Interests – who is the stakeholder and what are his interests
* normal flow – the normal case / GoodCase
* alternative flow –  if necessary, variations or errors

Who knows Use Cases will notice that the objective dimension is missing. In our case the overview dimension suffices in most instances.
