##### UseCase (5.)
UseCases are the classical representatives for functional requirements. 
Sources for functional requirements are the wished functional features or are derived from legal conditions (e.g. privacy). UseCases are closely associated with the budget sponsoring stakeholder.
A UseCase describes how a system allows an actor to reach a target. 
* ID – the unique identifier, is set one time at the beginning.
* title – the title, a short summary
* state – [premature, mature, deprecated]
* actor – who is the doer
* stakeholdersAndInterests – who is the stakeholder and what are his interests
* normalFlow – the normal case / GoodCase
* alternativeFlow –  if necessary, variations or faults

Who knows UseCases will notice that the objective dimension is missing. In our case the overview dimension suffices in most instances.
