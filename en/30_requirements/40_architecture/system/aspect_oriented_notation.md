##### Aspect-oriented user requirements notation
A further helpful notation for functional requirements is the so-called aspect-oriented user requirements notation. With this notation the cross-sectional functional requirements can be described well. A typical example for such a cross-sectional requirement are e.g. the rights of roles or error logging.
