#Architecture

Principles are:
* ConfigurationIsData : DevOps configures System by providing simple data.
* CompositionOverInheritance : DevOps compose modules in order to build higher level stacks.
* SeparateDomainFromInfrastructure : We use lowlevel configuration as anti corruption layer against infrastructure.
* ConventionOverConfiguration : DevOps can create conventions.
* ExplicitStatemanagement: We will handle state explicit by declare facts.
* ConfigurationValidation: Every configuration is validated
