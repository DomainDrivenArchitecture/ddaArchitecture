#State

## Do we represent state and how can state be managed?
If state is not managed, we will find state scattered across the whole system and modules. In order to omit this scattered state, we will introduce facts. Facts will follow these Ideas:  
* We will name them.
* We will form a fact module, making all facts available to the whole system.
* We collected them from target systems in front of applying configuration.
