# Process Support
## How can Configuration Management support legacy processes like manual application rollouts?
During the time, we've not fully applied the DevOps automated way of rolling out systems, we should also provide a DevOps engineer controlled way to rollout changes.  

## How configuration application results should be structured?
In order to have an interface to manual process parts, we should have a report for every configuration run same as for every configured system.

## How can we communicate with other Configuration Management/ Provision Systems? 
We will not be able, to cover all DevOps processes with a single Configuration Management System. So we will need the ability to transport informations between systems. Keys from Specification Key Space will be candidates for exchange.
